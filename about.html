  <h1>The People</h1>
  Hi there!  Thanks for checking this out.  I'm David Harper, and I built this app
  (with some gracious help).
  I'm a new intern at PandaStrike, a web consulting firm based in Los Angeles, CA.
  PandaStrike specializes in the application of innovative technologies (Node.js,
  Elasticsearch, Redis, and of course CoffeeScript).  My background is in computational
  chemistry... which you could say makes me a little odd, haha, but PandaStrike embraces
  diversity and values novel solutions that are effective. We consult for a variety
  of clients and really strive to be a part of the local development/start-up community.
  If we sound cool to you, check us out or contact one of our Sage Pandas at...

  <h1>The Technology</h1>
  This app is constructed using
  CoffeeScript and HTML 5's Canvas element.  CoffeeScript is a variant of JavaScript
  that easier to read, write, and maintain -- All the while compiling into standard
  JavaScript.  While there are limitations to the processing speed of JavaScript,
  its acceptance as a Web Standard is unmatched.  The same can be said of
  the Canvas element. Overall, this app is a demonstration of modern web design:
  Apps like this one can be quickly be assembled, deployed using out-of-the-box components, and
  deliver platform-agnostic performance.

  <p>Though this source code is original, in-browser physics is an area of rapid
    development.  In particular, this simulator draws inspiration from
    Jasper Palfree of Well Caffeinated. </p>

  <h1>The Physics</h1>
  The N-Body problem is a classic among the physics and computer science fields.
  The solution to the system of equations that govern these body's motions cannot
  be expressed analytically... So, computers are employed to calculate their dynamics via
  brute-force means.  There are limits, though.  As you add more bodies, the
  complexity of the problem grows as O(n^2).  Fortunately, this app is 2-dimensional,
  meaning that it can keep up and deliver the results directly for
  animation. <br><br>

  Some parameters are available for you to modify.  Play with the strength of the
  attraction and see how you can control the behavior.
  When the
  simulation starts, the particles are evenly distributed. Because of this, they
  have access to so much kinetic energy that they are not gravitationally bound,
  they zip past each other. In order to change that, you can suck energy out of
  the system through collisions.  Try out the wall collision
  parameter.  Perfectly elastic collisions keep energy in the system, inelastic
  ones drain it out.  Turning on particle-particle collision makes use of inelastic
  collisions.  The particles will clump up and not go very far.
